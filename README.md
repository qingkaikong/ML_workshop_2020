# Machine Learning Workshop at BSL

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/qingkaikong/ML_workshop_2020/master)


## Introduction   

This folder will contain the material for the machine learning workshop for fun, most of the examples will be in seismology. 

## Structure of the repo

The folder is structured as:
* notebooks - folder contains all the Jupyter notebooks
* data - folder contains data used for examples


Note that this workshop aims to give you a sense of how machine learning works using Python and seismological examples. We assume you have basic working knowledge of Python. All the dependencies are listed in the *environment.yml* file with the versions specified. If you want to install the packages and run a local version on your own machine, the easiest way is to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), and use either conda or pip to install all the dependencies. 

## Content of the workshop

In this workshop, we will cover:  
* Introduction to ANN - Series 1
* Introduction to CNN - Series 2
* ...
